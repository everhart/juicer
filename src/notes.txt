A Graphic class will act as a base for all subsequent renderable objects
This graphic class will be defined to include a virtual draw method as well
as a constructor for initializing an instance of the graphic class using
an attribute.

The graphic class will be extended by the following classes:
    Text
    Media

Media will, essentially, be a textured graphic. This textured graphic
will primarily be used for images, but anything that can texture a surface
may extend it. For example, video data.

We will not disallow texture data from applying to non-rectangular shapes.
For example, we will allow textures to be applied to triangles, as this
will enable more detailed graphical effects.

This is done by carefully designing the constructors of media. Media will
include constructors that can take attribute information, that can take
image texture information and that can take color information.
